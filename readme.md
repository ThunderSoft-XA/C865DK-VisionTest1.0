# C865DK-VisionTest1.0 Developer documentation

## Brief introduction
This document mainly introduce how to train and generate a gesture classification TensorFlow JS model
,and then converted to the tflite model required by 845DK platform, providing AI model for VisionTest demo.

## The main development process:
1. Download gesture_classification web project
2. Run gesture_classification web project
3. Train gesture_classification TF Js Model
4. Convert TensorFlow.js to TensorFlow Lite Model at Google Colab
5. Download tflite mode from Google Colab

Please refer to <Project Dir>/doc/How-To-Get-TFlite-Model.docx for detail.
